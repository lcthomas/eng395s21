## Response Paper 1
* **Due Friday, Feb 5**
* **500-750 words**
* **.docx or .pdf**
* **Turn in via "Response Paper 1" portal on Blackboard Assignments page**

For this response paper, you will analyze a recent encounter you have had with data through the lens of one of our readings so far (please use the Gitelman and Jackson, the Rosenberg, or the Klein and D'Ignazio for this assignment -- not the Crawford). I recommend you focus on 1 concept, issue, or point from your selected reading and explain how this concept, issue, or point has inflected your understanding of your encounter with data. By a "recent encounter with data" I mean a time you have interacted, examined, and/or used data or a system or interface that relies on data in your daily life (in other classes, at work, for fun, whatever). How does the concept, issue, or point you have identified from your selected reading affect your understanding of or perspective on this encounter with data?

How you organize your response paper is up to you, but you should:
* Be specific – the more specific the better. Resist the temptation to generalize. Hone in on a specific concept, issue, or point from your selected reading and a specific encounter with data, or even specific aspects of this encounter.
* Incorporate quotes from your selected reading and explain what these quotes mean in the context of the encounter with data you are analyzing. Again, specificity and precision matter. Because this paper is quite short, it is much better to discuss 1 idea in some detail than it is to discuss 3 or 4 ideas generally and in a hurried way.
* Dive right in to your analysis. You don't need to waste time and space with introductory and concluding paragraphs. I'm not looking for your standard 5-paragraph academic essay here, and you don't need to have a fully fleshed out argument. Rather, I'm looking to see how you think through what your selected reading tells us about your encounter with data.

## Response Paper 2
* **Due Friday, Feb 12**
* **500-750 words**
* **.docx or .pdf**
* **Turn in via "Response Paper 2" portal on Blackboard Assignments page**

In this response paper, you will select 1 keyword from any of our readings so far in the class. There are two caveats: your keyword cannot be "data," and  the reading you discuss in this response paper should be different from the reading you discussed in response paper 1. First, you will define this keyword in the context of your selected reading (~1 paragraph). Next, you should discuss what you think is most important or unique about the author's articulation, use, or argument about this keyword for understanding the concept and/or history of data. How does this keyword help you to think about data in a new or different way?

We will talk more about what a keyword is in class, but in general, a keyword is a central term or concept in an author's argument. It can be a term that they invent, define, or expand on, and/or it can be a term that is important to understanding their argument. It should be a term they explicitly discuss or use.

How you organize your response paper is up to you, but you should:
* Be specific – the more specific the better. Resist the temptation to generalize. Hone in on a specific keyword and think about at least 1 thing that this keyword causes you to reconsider or understand differently about data.
* Incorporate quotes from your selected reading when defining or discussing your keyword. Again, specificity and precision matter. Because this paper is quite short, it is much better to discuss 1 idea in some detail than it is to discuss 3 or 4 ideas generally and in a hurried way.
* Dive right in to your definition and analysis. You don't need to waste time and space with introductory and concluding paragraphs. I'm not looking for your standard 5-paragraph academic essay here, and you don't need to have a fully fleshed out argument. Rather, I'm looking to see how you think through the importance of your keyword.
