# Algorithm Audit
* **Due during finals week**
    * **You will submit part 1 of your algorithm audit plan by Friday, April 9**
    * **You will complete a draft of part 2 of your algorithm audit plan and bring it to class on Monday, April 19**
    * **You will submit part 2 of your algorithm audit plan by Friday, April 23**
* **2000-2500 words (~7-8 pages double-spaced)**
* **MLA/Chicago style**
* **Turn in via the "Algorithm Audit" portal on Blackboard Assignments page**

You will identify an algorithmic process you want to study and design a hypothetical or proof-of-concept “audit” of this process, taking into consideration how the process functions, what data it uses, and its most important effects and consequences. Your paper will describe your (theoretical) audit design while also situating the algorithm you have chosen and your audit process in the context of the class and the major issues we have discussed. I will update this assignment page as we near the end of the semester, and we will talk more about this assignment in class.
