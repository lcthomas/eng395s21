# Course Calendar
Readings are due – meaning they should be completed – on the dates indicated. If readings are not linked on this page, they can be found in our class Google drive folder.

The most accurate and up-to-date version of this calendar can be found on our course site. Use the online calendar to check on reading assignments, rather than this print version, since the print version of this syllabus will not be updated throughout the semester.

I reserve the right to change the course calendar as needed; adequate advance notice will always be given of any changes.
